# ALMA Cold Region Tracker Dynamic Event Detection and Analysis

## Overview
This library implements a methodology for analyzing cold regions using **ALMA** Band 3 observations.  It is the **FIRST publicly available method** found on the internet that performs this specific task.  The main goal is to track dynamic events (cold regions) by detecting local minima in the ALMA image data and following their movement across frames over time. The library processes groups of events by using ALMA observational data to detect and track local minima across frames. This analysis allows users to determine the trajectory of these dynamic events over time and provides detailed information on their movement.

## Features

- **Detection of local minima**: The library detects local minima in ALMA image data frames using the `scikit-image` library and its `peak_local_max` function.
- **Tracking of cold regions**: Once a local minimum is identified, the library tracks its position across subsequent frames based on distance criteria.
- **Trajectory extraction**: Produces a vector of coordinates representing the event's trajectory across time.

# Methodology Summary

## 1. Event Selection and Frame Identification
The library begins by selecting an event from the data. Each event is associated with a specific frame in the observational data, from which the analysis starts. For example, in the case of ALMA observations, a particular event is located in **Frame 100**, which corresponds to **UTC 15:54:12 on April 12, 2018**.

It is important to note that the ALMA data available in **SALSA** is divided into scans, and one must select a frame near the middle of the scan to accurately track the cold regions both forward and backward. For instance, if **Scan 1** contains 100 frames, the recommended frame to select for local minimum detection and tracking should be close to **Frame 50**.


## 2. Local Minima Detection
Using the `peak_local_max` function from the `scikit-image` library, the library identifies all local minima in each frame. The following configuration is used:

- Local minima are found below the average temperature.
- A minimum distance between two local minima is set to zero.

## 3. Tracking of Events

The library tracks the event's position by comparing its coordinates across frames. The distance between the event's position in the current frame and the local minima in the next frame is calculated. If the distance is less than the diameter of a circle whose area is equal to the average beam area of ALMA, the event is considered to persist in the subsequent frame. This process continues until the distance exceeds the threshold.

This tracking process is performed both forward and backward in time, starting from the event's frame, ensuring continuous tracking. For example, the library tracks an event from frame 100 to **frame 150** and interrupts the tracking if the distance between the event and the local minima exceeds the threshold in **frame 151**.


# Inputs and Parameters

## Event Tracking

- **Frame Number** (*int*): The frame number in the observational data where the event is first identified.

- **Distance Threshold** (*float*): The threshold distance between the event's position in the current frame and local minima in the next frame. If the distance exceeds this threshold, tracking is interrupted.

- **Local Minima Detection**: Performed using the `peak_local_max` function with a minimum distance of zero and local minima below the average temperature.

## Example Usage

The ALMA data used for this analysis was obtained from the [Solar ALMA Science Archive (SALSA)](http://sdc.uio.no/salsa/) the D06 Observation of ALMA Band 3.


### Event Tracking and Local Minima Detection

Cold regions were identified based on their lower brightness temperatures, as shown in **panel (c) of Figure below**. To differentiate cold from warm regions, a temperature threshold was set at the mean brightness temperature, including approximately 45% of the pixels (see red line in **panel (a)**).

The spatial resolution of ALMA was determined by calculating the average beam area. The radius of a circle with an area equal to the ALMA beam was used to establish a minimum distance between events. This radius is shown by the red line in **panel (b)**.

In **panel (c)**, the blue circle with a 33-arcsec radius encloses the area where cold regions were searched. Events within this area were tracked across frames, while those at the edges of the field of view were excluded.

```python
from alma_processor import ALMADataProcessor
import numpy as np

# Initialize the processor with the path to ALMA data
processor = ALMADataProcessor('/path/to/alma/file.fits')

# Step 1: Compute the statistics of the ALMA cube
std_alma_cube = processor.compute_alma_cube_statistics(plot_histogram=False)

# Step 2: Detect local minima with different settings
vector_min_0_diameter = processor.detect_local_extrema(
    sigma_criterion=0, times_radio=0, plot_histogram=False)

vector_min_2_diameter = processor.detect_local_extrema(
    sigma_criterion=0, times_radio=2, plot_histogram=True)

# Step 3: Choose a specific frame and filter points based on a distance threshold
frame = 100  # The frame where the event is first identified
minimum_num = 3  # The index of the specific local minimum to track
radius_with_search_mininums = 110  # Threshold distance in pixels or arcseconds

points_data_track = processor.filter_points(
    vector_min_2_diameter,
    frame=frame,
    distance_threshold=radius_with_search_mininums,
    plot_minimums=True)

# Select a specific point from the detected local minima to track
selected_point = points_data_track[minimum_num].copy()

# Step 4: Define the distance threshold for tracking the event
# This threshold is based on the average beam area of ALMA
# SPACE RESOLUTION CRITERION 
distance = (
    np.sqrt(np.mean(processor.beammajor) * np.mean(processor.beamminor))
    / processor.pixel_size_arcsec)

# Define the range of frames for scanning (start to end)
scand = [0, processor.almacube.shape[0]]  # Adjust based on the data

# Step 5: Compute the trajectory of the selected event across multiple frames
all_local_min, total_index = processor.compute_trajectory(
    selected_point, frame, distance, vector_min_0_diameter, scand)

# The result, `all_local_min`, contains the trajectory of the event,
# and `total_index` contains the corresponding frame indices.
```

## Results


The figure below illustrates the temporal evolution of a dynamic cold region observed by **ALMA**. The event is tracked using local minima detected across multiple frames. In **frame 100** (corresponding to **UTC 15:54:12 on April 12, 2018**), the local minimum of the event is marked with a green star.

- The panels labeled **t1** and **t2** show moments 90 and 50 seconds before the event in frame 100.
- The panels **t4** and **t5** represent moments 30 and 70 seconds after the event, respectively.

The blue points represent other local minima detected in the vicinity of the event. As time progresses, the event is tracked across multiple frames, and its movement is highlighted by the shifting position of the green star. The event is no longer detected in **t1** and **t5**, indicating that the local minimum exceeded the tracking threshold at these times.



## Application of the Methods 
This method has proven to perform well for studying cold regions observed by **ALMA** in Band 3. The figure below shows temperature variations in time-distance diagrams, centered on the spatial coordinates obtained from the tracking method within a 6x6 arcsec window for six cold events.

## Conclusion
This library allows users to perform detailed tracking of cold regions observed through ALMA by detecting local minima and following events over time. It provides valuable insights into the movement of these regions across frames, aiding in the analysis of dynamic solar events.

However, the method has some limitations, particularly when there is insufficient contrast between local minima in consecutive frames. In some cases, the tracking process halts because a clear local minimum cannot be detected. In other cases, when there is little contrast, the method continues tracking an event across the entire scan, even though local minima are present in the region but may not represent the true event because ALMA cannot resolve them. This issue stems from the relatively low spatial resolution of ALMA.
