# ALMA Cold Region Tracker Dynamic Event Detection and Analysis

## Overview
This library implements the methodology described for analyzing cold regions using **ALMA** Band 3 observations.  It is the **first publicly available method** found on the internet that performs this specific task.  The main goal is to track dynamic events (cold regions) by detecting local minima in the ALMA image data and following their movement across frames over time.
The library processes groups of events by using ALMA observational data to detect and track local minima across frames. This analysis allows users to determine the trajectory of these dynamic events over time and provides detailed information on their movement.
